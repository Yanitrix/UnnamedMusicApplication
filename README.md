# UnnamedMusicApplication

So once upon a time we made a party, I made a playlist (I was bascially djing). The PC was not mine tho, so the music there was played with Groove Music but it wasn't so convenient.
So I came up with the idea to make my own app for playing music (similar to Winamp or AIMP) that would make it easier to create playlists, play songs and integrate it with an android app (similar to how Spotify lets you bind your PC and phone).
I made some basic data model, and song queue implementation. I even had the idea to implement my own music player from scratch (basic on windows/unix apis for music), but right now I don't have enough knowledge about playing music on a PC to do it. Right now I'm working on my other personal project so this is gotta wait. But I hope that after some time I'll come back here and make something fancy.
So it would be: a desktop app (maybe Avalonia UI, because its cross platform AFAIK), a music player, some sql lite database for storing songs URLs (all music files would be on the PC's drive), an android app connecting with the desktop one (preferably Flutter because I know that technology).
I think it would be fun and help me being DJ (as soon as the lockdown's gone, bc right now it's quite hard to make a party), and it would be fun to understand some of os-level apis, etc. Generally, playing with low-level stuff is fun.

That's all I wanted to say, have a nice day whoever's reading that. Good bye.
